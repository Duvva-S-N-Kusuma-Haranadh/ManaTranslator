# ðŸ“„ ManaTranslator Project Report

## Overview

ManaTranslator is a Streamlit-based AI translation web app that allows users to enter text in any language and translate it into **Telugu**. It detects the input language automatically and stores translation pairs for corpus building with user consent. The app contributes to **viswam.ai**'s mission of collecting diverse language data for low-resource Indian languages.

## Goals

- Build a functional app in 1 week
- Allow users to input text without language selection
- Translate to Telugu using AI (Google Translate)
- Log translations and create corpus dataset with user consent
- Display history and allow transparency in collected data

## Tools Used

- Python, Streamlit
- langdetect (language detection)
- deep-translator (Google Translate wrapper)
- pandas (data logging)

## Features

- Instant language detection and translation to Telugu
- User interface for easy input and result display
- Translation history viewer
- Corpus collection stored in structured CSV
- Consent-based data usage

## Outcomes

- Fully working app with translation and logging
- Basic deployment-ready
- Extensible for audio input/output, gamified translation, or mobile-first design

## Future Work

- Add speech-to-text input and voice output
- Public deployment and Android PWA version
- Launch a user campaign for corpus contribution
- Add analytics dashboard and leaderboard
